## Typography

Typography has to be completely rethinked.

The old, standard way &mdash; Bauhaus, Swiss, minimal &mdash; was perfect in a static environment like print. Now we have animated type, dynamic CSS units, variable fonts and viewports, spatial AR / VR typography.

And less attention.

### Classic and Experimental

We need a classic and an experimental typographic system.

Classic used to style old-form content like long text &mdash; we can't avoid this type of content. It will be always present.

Experimental used to style presentational content like landing pages, storytelling, and whatever needs a short span of attention.

## Classic typography

*Invented* by Bauhaus a century ago classic typography is still relevant today. Everything static on print &mdash; books, magazines, posters &mdash; and everything static on screen &mdash; blogs, marketing websites, social networks &mdash; are using its principles.

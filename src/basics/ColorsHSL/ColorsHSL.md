## Colors with HSL

### Pick a background color

1. Perhaps it should be *warm*, which is the right half of the HSL scale, like hue starting from 180deg.
2. Perhaps it should be *desaturated* a bit (100% &rarr; 85%), not fully shiny.
3. If you want the text color to be dark add more *light* (50% &rarr; 85%) to the background. This is the default for now.
4. If you want text color to be light reduce *light* in background color (try 25%) and increase in text color (try 85%).

### Pick a Text color

1. Start form black, which is set the same as the background color but with 0% lightness.
2. You can increase / decrease lightness up to a level where the text color is still eligible on the background, ie. the color contrast ratio is bigger than 4.5

### Auto generated monochrome palette

1. You'll get the inverse color scheme.
2. You'll get all other color schemes as shades of primary colors which are still eligible.

## To do

- We need real use cases like a blog, a landing page, or a marketing site.
- This need is also on the Hockney grid's to-do list.
- These real use cases must be semantic, ie themeable. We should be able to throw a color pair on the hero, ie we should know the hero must have an inverted color scheme. In short, picking up two colors should be enough to completely style these use cases through semantics.

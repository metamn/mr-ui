## Theming

Theming is about global style variables: let the application be built on a common set of parameters like colors, fonts, spacing, and more.

Once optional today theming is mandatory. Now the operating system can request a light and dark mode for every app or website.

Before React Context theming was complicated. It was offered by various style frameworks via special constructs like `<ThemeProvider>`.

Now theming can be done without any styling framework just with simple React code.

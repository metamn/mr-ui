## Colors

A quick study on colors for user interfaces. Built bottom up, kept as minimal as possible.

## The basic need

We need at least two colors to have an UI. A text color and the background color.

These can be easily chosen; we just have to be sure their color contrast ratio is good enough to be legible, visible for all kind of audiences, even for those with visual impairments.

Two colors are good enough for a blog.

When more content types are present &mdash; buttons for call to action; multiple visual sections like hero, features, testimonials &mdash; two colors might not be enough.

## Monochromatic

With two colors we get additionally another good few color combinations. First an inverted color scheme, then a lot others in between.

These combinations could be well enough for a basic landing page.

Hero is set with inverted colors, the button / call to action on hero with the default colors.
Later, less important sections can have in between colors, such as gray in the case of black / white primary colors.

## +1 color

It's so refreshing to break out a monochromatic color scheme with a vivid call to action button. That's why user interfaces tend to be built on more than two colors.

When a new color is added to the two basic, primary colors the need is either to dominate them, or be dominated.

A call to action should dominate the existing color scheme by bringing its content forward, closer to the viewer.

A less important section based on a new color should sink into the background.

Theory says warm colors dominate, cool colors sink. On the classic color wheel warm colors are on the left: red, orange, yellow &mdash; cool colors on the right: violet, blue, green.

## The Metamn React User Interface

This is a user interface library built with React components.

Instead of being A Yet Another UI Library / Design System with mandatory components like Button, Accordion, Hero and co &mdash; it tries to come up with fresh ideas *always* following industry standards.

Beside code every component lists all resources which influenced design decisions and offered inspiration, making this library also a collection of articles about web development best practices.  

### Principles

1. **Minimal &mdash;** Use as few components as possible to avoid locking into creating the same looking user interfaces all over again.
2. **Curated &mdash;** Always look for existing solutions from the vast React ecosystem.
3. **Edge &mdash;** Incorporate the latest advancements and leave the rest for others.

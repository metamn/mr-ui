# Classic Typography

## Theory

*Invented* by Bauhaus a century ago classic typography is still relevant today. Everything static on print &mdash; books, magazines, newspapers, posters &mdash; and everything static on screen &mdash; graphic design, blogs, marketing websites, social networks &mdash; are using its principles.

Minimal typography is built on a basic assumption: there is always a *body text* in a content; there is always something to read. A long form text like an article, a book chapter, a description &mdash; or a short form text like an event invitation with details.

The main goal of this kind of typography is to make the reader read the text, and, to offer help when the text is too long or diverse. It wraps into chapters, sections and subsections with title; it decorates with quotes, asides, tables, first letter initials, spacers &mdash; and so on.

Minimal typography's basic rule is to set the body text first:

1. Let it have the smallest font size possible which is still perfectly readable.
2. Use a typeface meant for reading.
3. Set the text width to 60-80 characters which makes reading easy.


## Theory and practice

[Iain Lamb](http://lamb.cc/typograph/) came up with a fantastic essay and tool to help lay out the basics of classical typography. Please make yourself happy by reading it now, then come back, if ever necessary.

## Practice in a responsive environment

In 2009 there was no responsive design.

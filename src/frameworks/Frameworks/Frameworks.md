### Gatsby

- it works: https://github.com/metamn/gatsby-wordpress
- but it has limitations, see the README in the repo

### Wordpress

- REST API is very very slow: [article on Smashing Magazine, Oct 2018](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/10/headless-wordpress-decoupled/)
- [GraphpQL ???](https://www.wpgraphql.com/)
- Not ready yet for prime time: https://indigotree.co.uk/how-use-wordpress-headless-cms/, https://hashnode.com/post/should-i-start-using-headless-wordpress-for-client-projects-cjbm117dd011h5ewtca8nh5t3

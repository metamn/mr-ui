## Media Queries

- Media Queries are the classic way to react an entire site on screen size and viewport changes.
- With React we can implement them both render time and inside the styled components.
- For render time the [React-Responsive](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive) package is used.

### Example

- Try to resize the viewport.
- The text will change using the react package, the text background will change via styled components.

## The Metamn React User Interface

This is a user interface library built with React components.

Instead of being A Yet Another UI Library / Design System with mandatory components like Button, Accordion, Hero and co &mdash; it tries to come up with fresh ideas following web design and development's best practices.

React is an un-opinionated framework which means a result can be achieved in many ways depending on the author skillset and taste. Here we strive for simplicity and standards.

### Principles

1. **Minimal &mdash;** Use as few components as possible to avoid locking into creating the same looking user interfaces all over again.
2. **Curated &mdash;** Look first for existing solutions from the vast React ecosystem.
3. **Edge &mdash;** Incorporate the latest advancements.

### Structure

1. **Basics &mdash;** Basic building blocks like responsiveness, theming, typography, performance.
2. **Components &mdash;** Re-usable, styleable hand made components.
3. **Frameworks &mdash;** Integrating the UI library with other frameworks.
4. **Playground &mdash;** Mini projects to play with.

Beside code all resources are listed which influenced design decisions and offered inspiration. You can read this Storybook as a curated list of articles around the latest in web design and development.

This work is currently a work in progress in a very early stage.

## Responsiveness

Use element / container queries instead of media queries.

Why?

- Media queries are bound to devices, element queries are independent of devices.
- With media queries the code has to be adapted to an ever growing list of devices with different sizes.
- With media queries the UI is not prepared for unknown scenarios.
- With element queries the UI works regardless of the device.

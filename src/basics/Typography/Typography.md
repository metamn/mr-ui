## Typography

Typography has to be completely rethinked.

The old, standard way &mdash; Bauhaus, Swiss, minimal &mdash; was perfect in a static environment like print. Now we have animated type, dynamic CSS units, variable fonts and viewports, spatial AR / VR typography.

And less attention.

### Classic and Experimental

We need both a classic and an experimental typographic system.

Classic used to style old-form content like long text &mdash; we can't avoid this type of content. It will be always present.

Experimental used to style presentational content like landing pages, storytelling, and whatever needs a short span of attention.

## Classic typography

*Invented* by Bauhaus a century ago classic typography is still relevant today. Everything static on print &mdash; books, magazines, newspapers, posters &mdash; and everything static on screen &mdash; blogs, marketing websites, social networks &mdash; are using its principles.

Minimal typography is built on a basic assumption: there is always a *body text* in a content; there is always something to read. A long form text like an article, a book chapter, a description &mdash; you name it.

The main goal of this kind of typography is to make the reader read the text, and, to offer help when the text is too long. Wrap into chapters, sections and subsections with title, decorate with quotes, asides, tables, first letter initials and so on.

Minimal typography's first rule is to set the body text in the most readable way:

1. Let it have the smallest font size possible which is still enjoyable.
2. Use a typeface meant for reading.
3. Set the text width to 60-80 characters which makes reading easy.

These three are defining the typographic grid where everything else &mdash; headings, quotes, figures, figure captions &mdash; are aligned.

Every new element has to differ in a minimum amount of properties from the body text. You don't let your fantasies go wild here. Just compose up with care.

For example if your text has just one heading you don't increase it's size. You make it bold and space generously from previous and next elements. This way it won't be confused with bold text inside the body text, and, will differ in a minimal way from the body text itself.

This approach of constructing typography for print, then later for user interfaces is highly effective and still brings in creativity offered by the unlimited typefaces, colors, images and other decorators available.

### Experimental typography

The problem with classic typography lies in it's foundation, basic assumptions:

1. There *isn't* always something to read.
2. Even if it is, the reader has not enough time, or doesn't want to read it through.
3. The 'smallest font size which is still enjoyable' could be easily set on a fixed medium with a fixed font.

Today with smartwatches, smartphones, tablets, emojis, interactive installations, moving images and text, variable fonts, skim reading, likes and shares, immersive computing &mdash; we need other assumptions.

1. Content is interactive.
2. People want tangible, immersive, immediate experiences.
3. Both the medium and the tools of creation are unknown, or infinitely variable.

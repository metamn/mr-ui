## Colors with HSL

### Pick a background color

1. Perhaps it should be *warm*, which is the right half of the HSL scale, like hue starting from 180deg.
2. Perhaps it should be *desaturated* a bit (100% &rarr; 85%), not fully shiny.
3. If you want the text color to be dark add more *light* (50% &rarr; 85%) to the background. This is the default for now.
4. If you want text color to be light reduce *light* in background color (try 25%) and increase in text color (try 85%).

### Pick a Text color

1. Start form black, which is set the same as the background color but with 0% lightness.
2. You can increase / decrease lightness up to a level where the text color is still eligible on the background, ie. the color contrast ratio is bigger than 4.5

### Auto generated monochrome palette

1. You'll get the inverse color scheme.
2. You'll get all other color schemes as shades of primary colors which are still eligible.

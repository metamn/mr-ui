## Text Around Circle

Displays a text like being wrapped around a circle.

### How it works?

1. The text is split into chars
2. Chars are rotated around a circle.

### Simple usage

Set up a rectangle and add a text.

The text should fit the rectangle. If it's too long the characters might overlap.

You can use the Knobs to check whether the text fits it's container.

#### Example

```React
<TextAroundCircle text="Demo Text" size="20em" />
```
